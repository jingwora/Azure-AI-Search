### TF/IDF (BM25)
**Description:**
- BM25 (Best Matching 25) is an advanced form of the TF/IDF ranking function used to estimate the relevance of documents based on query terms.
- TF/IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. It is used to score the importance of a term in a document relative to its frequency across all documents.
- BM25 improves upon TF/IDF by introducing document length normalization and saturation parameters, making it more effective for information retrieval.

**How It Works:**
- **Term Frequency (TF):** Measures how frequently a term appears in a document.
- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):** Measures how common or rare a term is across all documents in the collection.
- **Document Length Normalization:** Adjusts the relevance score based on the length of the document to prevent bias towards longer documents.

### Vector Similarity (Cosine)
**Description:**
- Vector similarity measures the similarity between two vectors, often used to determine the similarity between documents or between a query and documents.
- Cosine similarity is a common method that calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors, providing a similarity score between -1 and 1.

**How It Works:**
- **Vector Representation:** Text or data is transformed into vectors using techniques such as word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT).
- **Cosine Similarity Calculation:** Computes the cosine of the angle between two vectors, which indicates how similar the two vectors are. A value of 1 means they are identical, 0 means they are orthogonal (no similarity), and -1 means they are diametrically opposite.

### Semantic Search
**Description:**
- Uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand the context and meaning of search terms. Provides more relevant search results by interpreting the intent behind the query.
- Semantic search enhances search relevance through contextual understanding and semantic ranking.

**How It Works:**
- **Natural Language Processing:** Analyzes the query to understand its context and meaning.
- **Semantic Ranking:** Ranks documents based on the semantic similarity to the query, rather than just keyword matching.
- **Extractive Answers and Captions:** Provides precise answers and highlights relevant text passages directly from the documents.

**Commonly Used Models:**
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):** A transformer-based model that excels in understanding the context of words in a sentence.
- **RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach):** An optimized version of BERT that improves performance on various NLP tasks.
- **DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention):** An advanced variant of BERT that enhances performance by improving the model‚Äôs ability to understand and represent language structure.


### Hybrid Search
**Description:**
- Hybrid search combines traditional keyword-based search methods (like BM25) with vector-based semantic search to leverage both exact keyword matches and contextual understanding.
- This approach enhances the relevance and accuracy of search results by considering both the precise occurrence of keywords and the semantic meaning behind them.

**How It Works:**
- **Keyword Search (BM25):** Performs traditional keyword matching and relevance scoring using the BM25 algorithm.
- **Vector Search:** Uses vector similarity techniques to find semantically similar documents based on vector representations.
- **Result Merging:** Combines the results from both searches, often re-ranking them based on a combined relevance score to produce a comprehensive set of search results.
